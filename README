[email]So, you mentioned that you wanted to write some code that simulated
the Monty Hall problem. [/email]

I was thinking that it could be a python script which did the following.
1) Asked for how many games to play.
2) For game n:
 a) randomly select a door
 b) was fixed to select a door
3) Show one of the other two doors that isn't a winner
4) For game n:
 a) randomly chose to swap doors
 b) was fixed to swap or not
5) Show the winner and see if you won
6) Store stats so we could see this output:

Games: 10000
Games won w/ door switch: xxxx (xx%)
Games won w/o door switch: xxxx (xx%)
